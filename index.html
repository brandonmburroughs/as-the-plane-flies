        <h1>As The Plane Flies - Visualizing Flight Time vs Distance</h1>
        <h3>By Brandon M. Burroughs</h3>
        <br>

        <p>Many years ago, I was flying from Washington, DC to Shreveport, LA (my hometown) to visit family.  Shreveport has a small airport (SHV) that almost always requires connecting through DFW, IAH, or ATL.  Connections are often awkwardly timed; you get to choose between a <1 hour mad dash or a 2-3 hour trial of patience before taking the ~1 hour flight to SHV.  As I was wandering through the various terminals of DFW, looking at all the places I could be going, I began to think about distance as a function of miles vs hours.  While DCA is ~150 miles closer to SHV than DFW, it takes an extra 2-4 hours to get to SHV due to the connection through DFW.  DFW is super connected while SHV is a bit of an island.</p>

        <p>When you look at a map of the US, the distance between cities on the map corresponds to the physical distance.  But the ability to fly directly between specific cities shrinks the country considerably.  This has interesting affect, shrinking the country from the perspecitive of one city, while streching it out from the perspective of another.  Let's take a look at a few examples.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Dallas (DFW)</h2>
            <p>As the largest American Airlines hub, Dallas is a super-connected city, effectively shrinking most of the country towards it.  The coasts are closer, the middle of the country is closer, and there are many direct flights available to mid-sized and smaller cities.</p>
            <iframe
                class="map-embed"
                src="map.html?origin=DFW&mode=flightTime&airports=69&directOnly=true&embed=true&waitForViewport=true"
                title="Flight times from Dallas/Fort Worth"
                loading="lazy"
                scrolling="no"
                style="overflow: hidden;"
            ></iframe>
            <p class="caption">Toggle between Geographic Distance and Flight Time to see the difference.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Shreveport (SHV)</h2>
            <p>With a small airport, Shreveport is a bit of an isolated island when it comes to flying.  Most of the country is just as far away, if not farther, and direct flights mostly route you to major hubs.</p>
            <iframe
                class="map-embed"
                src="map.html?origin=SHV&mode=flightTime&airports=150&directOnly=true&embed=true&waitForViewport=true"

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Austin (AUS)</h2>
            <p>Austin, with its mid-sized airport and direct flights to major cities, the coasts become close.  But many mid-sized or smaller cities requrie connections and remain far away.</p>
            <iframe
                class="map-embed"
                src="map.html?origin=AUS&mode=flightTime&airports=69&directOnly=true&embed=true&waitForViewport=true"
                title="Flight times from Austin"

            ></iframe>
            <p class="caption">Toggle between Geographic Distance and Flight Time to see the difference.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>San Francisco (SFO)</h2>
            <p>SFO is bigger than AUS but not as well connected as DFW.  The large availability of direct flights brings the East Coast much closer to the West Coast, but many mid-sized and smaller cities still require a connection.</p>
            <iframe
                class="map-embed"
                src="map.html?origin=SFO&mode=flightTime&airports=69&directOnly=true&embed=true&amp;waitForViewport=true"

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I often lament the fact that my family doesn't live near a larger airport as it would make visiting them much easier.  Creating this visualization has helped put a picture to what I knew from many years of experience.  Given that my family isn't likely to move, I've at least learned how to travel well and make the most of my time in DFW.</p>

            <h2>A Few Assumptions and Considerations</h2>
            <p>Feel free to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/brandonmburroughs/as-the-plane-flies">the code</a>, but here are few assumptions I've made.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The flight times are based upon Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) data from January 2025 to October 2025.  See <a href="https://github.com/brandonmburroughs/as-the-plane-flies/blob/main/scripts/raw-data/README.md">here</a> for more info on how this data was used.</li>
                <li>Anomalously long/short flights are filtered out of the dataset and then the average is calculated for each route.</li>
                <li>Flights with connections use a 90 minute layover duration regardless of the connecting airport.</li>
                <li>The "Flight Time" option calculates the ratio of actual travel time vs what would be expected based upon geogrpahic distance between the origin airport and all other airports.  If a city requires a connection to get to, the ratio will be larger, pushing that city farther away.  If there is a direct flight, the ratio will be smaller and will bring the city closer.</li>
                <li>This doesn't take into account some real world considerations such as the airport size (e.g. larger airports likely have more options), multiple airports in one city (e.g. the Bay Area has SFO and SJC, you could combine the flights into one), or different comfort levels with short/long layovers depeneding upon airport (e.g. I know DFW well and can tolerate a short layover).  I'll leave these as an exercise to the reader.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How This Came To Be</h2>
            <p>This idea occurred to me nearly ten years ago, but I never took the time to figure out how to make it work.  At the time, I knew enough JS/D3/Math to create the map visualization and think through the map morph, but I never got too far and shelved the project.</p>
            <p>Now living in the Bay Area, I take many flights from SFO to SHV and have been thinking of this idea again.  In those ten years, coding tools like Claude Code have exploded and made it easier to build things.  Claude and I created a spec based upon my idea and went to work.  There was some back and forth and a bit of manual tweaking of the data collection/visualization parameters, but 99.9% of the code was written by Claude.  It's amazing what is within reach with these tools.</p>
